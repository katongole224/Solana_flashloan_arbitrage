# Solana_flashloan_arbitrage
# Solana Flash Loan Arbitrage Bot

A high-performance arbitrage bot for Solana that uses Kamino flash loans and Jupiter aggregator to execute profitable trades across multiple DEXs.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Flash Loan Integration**: Utilizes Kamino's flash loan protocol to borrow and repay SOL within a single transaction
- **Multi-DEX Arbitrage**: Scans for opportunities across all major Solana DEXs via Jupiter aggregator
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Implements Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect complex arbitrage paths
- **Jito Bundle Support**: Optional integration with Jito MEV bundles for guaranteed execution
- **Transaction Optimization**: Uses Address Lookup Tables (ALTs) to optimize transaction size
- **Detailed Reporting**: Logs all trades with timestamps and profitability metrics

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+ and npm
- Solana CLI (recommended for key management)
- A Solana wallet with at least 0.1 SOL for transaction fees
- Access to a reliable Solana RPC endpoint (Alchemy, QuickNode, etc.)

## ðŸ”§ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/solana-flashloan-]
cd solana-flashloan-arbitrage
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure your environment:
   - Create a wallet keypair or import an existing one
   - Set up your RPC endpoint
   - Adjust configuration parameters

## âš™ï¸ Configuration

Open `config.js` and update the following fields:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Required: Your wallet's private key (keep this secure!)
  PRIVATE_KEY: "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
  
  // Required: RPC endpoint URL
  RPC_ENDPOINT: "https://your-rpc-endpoint.com",
  
  // Flash loan settings (adjust as needed)
  KAMINO_FLASHLOAN_AMOUNT: "1000000000", // 1 SOL
  
  // Profit thresholds
  MIN_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE: 0.1, // 0.1% minimum gross profit threshold
  
  // Execution mode
  JITO_MODE: false, // Set to true to use Jito bundles
  
  // Scanning interval
  CHECK_INTERVAL: 5000, // Check every 5 seconds
  
  // Other optional settings...
};
```

âš ï¸ **Security Warning**: Never commit your private key to a public repository. Consider using environment variables for sensitive information.

## ðŸ”¬ Setup Address Lookup Tables

Before running the bot, set up Address Lookup Tables to optimize transaction size:

```bash
node setup-lookup-tables.js
```

This creates lookup tables that store frequently used account addresses, greatly reducing transaction size.

## ðŸš€ Usage

Start the arbitrage bot:

```bash
node index.js
```

The bot will:
1. Initialize your wallet and RPC connection
2. Set up necessary token accounts
3. Begin scanning for arbitrage opportunities
4. Execute trades when profitable opportunities are found
5. Log results to the console and trades directory

## ðŸ” Bot Strategies

### Flash Loan + Jupiter Arbitrage

The bot borrows SOL via a flash loan, performs a swap to another token (e.g., USDC), then swaps back to SOL. If the final SOL amount exceeds the borrowed amount plus fees, the trade is executed.

### Bellman-Ford Multi-Path Arbitrage

The more advanced strategy uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect arbitrage opportunities across multiple tokens. This can find complex paths that may offer higher profitability.

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Logs

The bot creates detailed log files in the `trades` directory:
- Successful trades are logged with profitability metrics
- Failed trades include error information for debugging

Console output provides real-time information about:
- Bot status and configuration
- Scan results and detected opportunities
- Trade execution and confirmation
- Error messages and debugging information

## âš¡ Performance Optimization

- **RPC Endpoint**: Use a premium RPC endpoint for faster responses
- **Flash Loan Amount**: Adjust the flash loan amount based on liquidity
- **Check Interval**: Balance between frequent checks and RPC rate limits
- **Safety Buffer**: Adjust to balance between capturing more opportunities and avoiding failed transactions

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Before running with real funds:
1. Test with a small flash loan amount
2. Monitor for a period to ensure profitability
3. Gradually increase amounts as you verify stability

## ðŸ“ Additional Notes

- **Slippage**: The bot uses a fixed slippage of 0.1% (100 basis points)
- **Fee Calculation**: Includes flash loan fees (0.05%) and optional Jito tips
- **Transaction Size**: Optimized to fit within Solana's transaction size limits
- **Token Support**: Currently supports SOL, USDC, USDT, and BONK tokens by default

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

- Store your private key securely
- Run the bot on a dedicated machine
- Monitor the bot regularly for unexpected behavior
- Implement stop-loss mechanisms for risk management
